# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Configure a job with multiple tasks.
# MAGIC - Get familiar with the Lakeflow Jobs UI.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ## C. Configure a Job with Multiple Tasks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This job will complete three simple tasks:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **File #1** – Ingest a CSV file and create the **bank_master_data_bronze** table in your schema.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **File #2** – Create a table named **borrower_details_bronze** in your schema.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **File #3** – Create a table named **loan_details_bronze** in your schema.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### C1. Add a Single Notebook Task
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by scheduling the first notebook [Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.1 - Ingesting Banking Data]($./Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.1 - Ingesting Banking Data) notebook. Click the hotlink in previous sentence to review the code.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The notebook creates a table named **bank_master_data_bronze** in your schema from the CSV file in the volume `/Volumes/databricks_bank_loan_modelling_dataset/v01/banking/loan-clean.csv`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right click on the **Jobs and Pipelines** button on the sidebar and select *Open Link in New Tab*. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Select the **Jobs & Pipeline** tab, and then click the **Create** button and choose **Job** from the dropdown.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. In the top-left of the screen, enter the **Job Name** provided above to add a name for the job (must use the job name specified above).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Choose **Notebook** from the recommended task. If it's not in the recommended list, select it by clicking **+Add another task type**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Configure the task as specified below. You'll need the values provided in the cell output above for this step.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Setting | Instructions |
# MAGIC |--|--|
# MAGIC | Task name | Enter **ingesting_master_data** |
# MAGIC | Type | Choose **Notebook** |
# MAGIC | Source | Choose **Workspace** |
# MAGIC | Path | Use the navigator to specify the **File #1** path provided above (notebook **Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.1 - Ingesting Banking Data**) |
# MAGIC | Compute | From the dropdown menu, select a **Serverless** cluster (We will be using Serverless clusters for jobs in this course. You can also specify a different cluster if required outside of this course) <br></br>**NOTE**: When selecting your all-purpose cluster, you may get a warning about how this will be billed as all-purpose compute. Production jobs should always be scheduled against new job clusters appropriately sized for the workload, as this is billed at a much lower rate. |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Click the **Create task** button.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 7. #####For better performance, please enable Performance Optimized Mode in Job Details. Otherwise, it might take 6 to 8 minutes to initiate execution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 8. Click the blue **Run now** button in the top right to start the job.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 9. Select the **Runs** tab in the navigation bar and verify that the job completes successfully.

Open the notebook and review the code.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook creates a table named **loan_details_silver** in your schema from the **bank_master_data_bronze** table created by the previous task.
